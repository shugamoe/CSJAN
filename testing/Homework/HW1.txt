7.  In heads up Texas hold 'em (two players, each dealt two
cards), find the probability that neither is dealt a pair (two cards
of the same rank). If there are three players, what is the probability
that none have a pair?

8. For a Poisson process N(,) with parameter \lambda, find the
probabilities of the following events: 

(a) N((1,5])>1 

(b) N((0,1]) = N((0,2]) 

(c) N((1,2]) + N((3,4]) = 6 

(d) N((0,1]) = N((1,2]) + m for m a nonnegative integer.
Express your answer as an infinite series and then write your result
in terms of a Bessel function (look it up).  This result in terms of
Bessel functions can be used to, for example, give a simple accurate
approximation to this probability when m is large.
