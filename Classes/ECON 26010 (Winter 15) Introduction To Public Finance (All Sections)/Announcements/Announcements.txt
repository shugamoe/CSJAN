Personalized feedback on the pset 2
Posted on: Monday, February 16, 2015 9:23:58 AM CST
Dear students,

I forgot to mention about getting specific feedback on the problem set 2. Due to the large number of students (about 140), I realized including specific feedback on each single pset was going to be a very time-intensive and long process for everyone. However, you still have the right to receive the feedback from your TAs. Consequently, I am happy to provide personalized specific feedback on my regular office hours.
Today, and every Monday, I will hold office hours in Stuart cafe at 4pm. If you think your grade is unfair, please come with a copy of your pset, and explain clearly and coherently why you deserve a better grade. Please do not come with because-a-friend-of-mine-did-the-same-and-I-got-a-lower-grade type of reasoning. I am sure you must be able to present your argument in a professional and academic way. I am very open to hear and discuss new alternatives to the suggested answers. Just be respectful, clear and consice in your speech.
David Coble.
