1. Rice, Chapter 1, 20: A deck of 52 cards has been shuffled
thoroughly. What is the probability that the four aces are next to
each other?

2. Rice, Chapter 1, 60: A factory runs three shifts. In a given day,
   1% of the items produced by the first shift are defective. 2% of
   the 2nd shift's items are defective, and 5% of the third shift's
   items are defective. If the shifts all have the same productivity,
   what percentage of the items produced in a day arte defective? If
   an item is defective, what is the probability that it was produced
   by the third shift?



3. Rice, Chapter 1, 72: Suppose that n components are connect6ed in
   series. For each unit, there is a bacvkup unit, and the system
   fails if and only if both a unit and its backup fail. Assuming that
   all the units are independent and fail with probability p, what is
   the probability that the system works? For n = 10 and p = 0.05,
   compare these results with those of Example F in Section 1.6.

4. Rice, Chapter 1, 78: This problem introduces some aspects of a
   simple genetic model. Assume that genes in an organism occur in
   pairs and that each member of the pair can be either of the typers
   a or A. The possible genotypes of an organism are then AA, Aa, and
   aa (aA and Aa are equivalent). When two organisms mate, each
   idependently contributes one of its two genes; either one of the
   pair is transmitted with probability 0.5.  

   (a) Suppose that the genotypes of the parents are AA and Aa. Find
   the possible genotypes of their offspring and the corresponding
   probabilities.

   (b) Suppose that the probabilities of the genotypes AA, Aa, and aa
   are p, 2q, and r, respectively, in the first generation. Find the
   probabilities in the second and third generations, and show that
   these are the same. This result is called the Hardy-Weinberg Law. 

5. Rice, Chapter 2, 8: Show that the binomial probabilities sum to 1.


6. Rice, Chapter 2, 28: Let p_0, p_1,...,p_n denote the probability
   mass function of the binomial distribution with parameters n and
   p. Let q=1-p. Show that the binomial probabilities can be computed
   recursively by p_0 = q^N and

            (n - k + 1)p
   p_n  =   ------------ p_{k - 1},   k = 1,2,3,....
                kq

   Use this relation to find P(X < 5) for n = 9000 and p = .0005.


7.  In heads up Texas hold 'em (two players, each dealt two
cards), find the probability that neither is dealt a pair (two cards
of the same rank). If there are three players, what is the probability
that none have a pair?

8. For a Poisson process N(,) with parameter \lambda, find the
probabilities of the following events: 

(a) N((1,5])>1 

(b) N((0,1]) = N((0,2]) 

(c) N((1,2]) + N((3,4]) = 6 

(d) N((0,1]) = N((1,2]) + m for m a nonnegative integer.
Express your answer as an infinite series and then write your result
in terms of a Bessel function (look it up).  This result in terms of
Bessel functions can be used to, for example, give a simple accurate
approximation to this probability when m is large.
