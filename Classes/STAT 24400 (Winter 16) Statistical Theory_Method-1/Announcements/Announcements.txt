My Wednesday Office Hours: Zoology 112
Posted on: Tuesday, March 8, 2016 10:53:18 AM CST
The Deapartment of Statistics is currently in transit between Eckhart and Jones, and I am essentially office-less. I'll have office hours tomorrow at 11AM in 112 Zoology, the seminar room across the hall from the box for turning in HW8, at the west end of the ground floor hallway. The door to Zoology from the breezeway next to Hutch courtyard is unlocked.

Dates and Times for Alternative Finals
Posted on: Tuesday, March 8, 2016 1:33:50 PM CST
Note a TIME CHANGE from what I told you in email.
One alternative final will be at 12:45PM (NOT 1PM) Friday, March 11, in 220 Zoology (the "Lillie Room").
Another alternative final will be at 9:30AM (NOT 10AM) Monday, March 14, in 220 Zoology (the 'Lillie Room").
I've moved the times a little earlier because someone else has the room at 3PM Friday and noon Monday. To get to the Lillie room, go up the main starcase in Zoology to the second floor and turn left. The Lillie room is at the east end of the hallway. The exam is 2 hours long.

Homework 8
Posted on: Thursday, March 3, 2016 12:42:57 PM CST
I'm about to post hw8. We are having a hw8 so that you will have had hw assigned for ALL possible final exam topics. Because of the move to Jones and the onset of Reading Period, hw8 will be due at 10 AM Thursday of Reading Period. The homework should be placed in a box outside of 110 Zoology (the box is there now, turn in the hw any time). This location was chosen because of the move to Jones. Note that door to Zoology from the breezeway near Botany Pond is always unlocked.

The Final
Posted on: Thursday, March 3, 2016 12:43:17 PM CST
We'll have the final at the Registar's official time, 1:30PM to 3:30PM, on Tuesday, March 15. Instead of our normal classroom, we'll have it in 107 Kent, the giant room we used for the midterm. Closed book, bring a scientific calculator. You may bring a single page of notes, written on both sides. (Twice as much notes as the midterm). I'll put up some example problems in the next day or two. These notes must be turned in with the exam.
Alternative times: A few of you have asked to take the final early. I'm tentatively planning to give two early finals, one at 10AM Friday of Reading period, and one at 10AM Monday of finals week. If you plan on taking the final early, please email me, even if you have so earlier. I need an accurate count at this point so I can think about rooms.

Moving to Jones
Posted on: Thursday, March 3, 2016 12:02:19 PM CST
On Monday, 3/7, my office will move to 312 Jones (JO312). The Departmental Office will move to 222 Jones. This will affect where you look for me and where to turn in homework.  I'll update you on Monday office hours, as both offices will be unusable then  -JR

Midterm Time and Room Change
Posted on: Thursday, January 28, 2016 2:16:08 PM CST
The midterm will be from 4:30PM to 6:30PM on Thursday February 4 in 107 Kent. It will NOT be at 3:00PM 2/4 in our regular classroom.

We're doing this in order to avoid crowding. We recognize that some of you may have scheduling issues. For that reason,it is possible to take the midterm at an alternative time Wednesday 2/3 or Thursday 2/4. As I write, I know that at least one person is taking it at 9:00AM Wednesday (the earliest possible alternative time). If you can't get to the regularly scheduled midterm, please email me no later than Monday, Feb. 1.
