Lecture 1: Elements of Probability Theory
Reading: Rice, Chapter 1; Stigler, 1.1-1.4.
Corrected notes posted  1/5 17:38. 'MonteHall.pdf' is some recreational reading from a biography of Paul Erdos; it is not formal class material.


Lecture 2: Random Variables
Reading: Rice, 2.1-2.2.1; Stigler: 1.5-1.7.


Lecture 3: Functions of Random Variables
Stigler: 1.8 (rest of Ch. 1); Rice 2..2.2 to 2.3


Lecture 4: Mean and Variance; Joint Distributions
Stigler2.1-2.5, 3.1-3.3; Rice 3.1-3.6; 4.1-4.2


Lecture 5: Expectations of Joint Distributions, Moments, and the CLT
Rice 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.2, 5.3; Stigler 3.4-3.8


Lecture 6: Bayesian Inference I
Rice 8.6; Stigler 4.1-4.4. Two minor typos corrected 1/26, two more 1/27.


Lecture 7: Bayesian Inference II; Intro to Maximum Likelihood
Stigler 4.4, 4.5; Rice 8.5


Lecture 8: Maximum Likelihood I
Stigler 5.5-5.4, Rice 8.4


Lecture 9 Midterm Review


Lecture 10: Maximum Likelihood 2
The reading is Stigler, 5.5 and 5.6; Rice, Chaper 6 and 8.5.2.


Lecture 11: Maximum Likelihood 3--Fisher's Approximation.
No new reading in Stigler--we are still working on the reading from last time. New reading in Rice: 8.5.1 and 8.7.


Lecture 12: MLE 4: Multidimensional case and Sketch of a Proof of Fisher's Theorem
Reading: Stigler 5.7


Lecture 13: Sufficiency and Intro to Hypothesis Testing
Reading:  Rice 8.8 (you may want to look at 4.1.1 as well); Stigler, Chapter 6 Intro and 6.1


Lecture 14: Hypothesis Testing and The Neyman-Pearson Lemma
Reading: Rice 9.4 and 9.5; Stigler 6.2-6.4 and 7.1-7.3 (errors corrected 0927, 2/24)


Lecture 15: Testing Composite Hypotheses
Reading: Rice 9.4 and 9.5; Stigler 7.4-7.6. More on Weldon's Dice in Labby09, posted as 'recreational reading.' 


Lecture 16: Testing for Homogeneity, P-values, Confidence Intervals.
Reading: Stigler 7.7-7.9, Chapter 8 (what there is of it), Rice 9.2-9.3 (some of this relates to the two previous lectures)


Lecture 17: Duality of Confidence Intervals and p-values; Chi Squared in New contexts
Reading: Rice 9.3 and 9.6, Examples A-C in 9.5.


Lecture 18: Rank Order Statistics and Topics for Review
Reading: Rice, 10.4.2 and 11.2.3 . The notes also contain a list of topics covered in class. You can use this list as is, but before downloading I urge you to go through the lecture notes and prepare your own list---it's a good way to learn to study.
