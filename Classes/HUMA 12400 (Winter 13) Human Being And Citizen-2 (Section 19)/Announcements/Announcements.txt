HBC DANTE LECTURE
Posted on: Friday, March 1, 2013 11:18:13 PM CST
dear class,
this coming monday, the 4th, there will be the HBC quarterly lecture, entitled "is dante's divine comedy supposed to be funny?" delivered by prof. justin steinberg, our university's very own dante scholar. the lecture will take place at 7 pm in kent 107, and last approximately 50 minutes with another 15 minutes or so of questions. to follow the lecture, you should have read up to inferno 23, which will be covered by keeping the reading schedule for our class. attendance to the lecture is mandatory, and only if there is absolutely no way you can make it, you may write to me with the reason, this requires my consent. but i hope to see all of you there - it's an interesting question certainly worth our time, and it will form part of our class discussion on tuesday.
have a great weekend!

your essay
Posted on: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 12:35:28 AM CST
  Dear class,
  We will return your essays sometime between now and today's class. Please make sure the comments make sense to you. If they don’t, get in touch with your grader immediately and we’ll explain. Despite the considerable difficulty of Augustine, this is another round of very successful essays – many of you even improved since the last essay! – and I am happy with the overall outcome. I hope you still have some gas in the tank for Dante – and I look forward to this final stretch of our journey.
  Best wishes,
Florian Klinger
